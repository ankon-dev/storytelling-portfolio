                My passion for creating digital experiences began during my college years when I discovered the perfect
                intersection of logic and creativity in web development. What started as curiosity about how websites
                work evolved into a deep love for crafting user-centered solutions.

                I believe that great design isn't just about aestheticsâ€”it's about solving real problems and creating
                meaningful connections between users and technology. Every project I undertake is an opportunity to tell
                a story, whether it's helping a startup launch their first product or reimagining how users interact
                with complex data.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 text-muted-foreground">
                My approach combines technical expertise with design thinking, ensuring that every line of code serves a
                purpose and every pixel contributes to the overall user experience. I'm constantly learning and adapting
                to new technologies, always seeking to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
